**2025-10-15**: Current status, PCB is done next order all required parts and 3d-printing.

The Low Profile - Numpad (lp-np) is my first attempt at creating my own PCB from scratch.
This was done with the long-lasting wish to create some hardware.
A keyboard (numpad in this case) is a first project with less complexity on the used parts and hardware.
In the past I gathered some experience in ordering and soldering a [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) keyboard
and for creating this project I used the Kicad files as a template.
This helped me to get the (hopefully) right schematic and after some trial and error a layout that looks right.
The next step is to order the parts and get hold on a hotplate.

## Parts and PCB footprint

The PCB design would not been possible without the aid of the [Corne](https://github.com/foostan/crkbd) keyboard project
where the base foodprint for the used ProMicro and display header originate from.
For the switches I got my hands on the Cherry MX ULP (Ultra Low Profile) Switches which
are pretty well documented in [the repo of pashutk](https://github.com/pashutk/Cherry_MX_ULP/tree/main).
Here example projects, footprints, datasheets and sourcing information can be found.

## Caps

For the caps, I resorted to 3D printing my own.
A base model can be found in the [zmk-config-mikefive repo of mikeholscher](https://github.com/mikeholscher/zmk-config-mikefive/).
This repo uses _Kailh PG1316S_ switches, which have a similar footprint to Cherry switches.
Keycap.step files for 3D printing can be found in the repository.
